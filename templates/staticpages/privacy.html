<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us. It is 900hl.com’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p>

<strong>Website Visitors</strong>
<p>Like most website operators, 900hl.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 900hl.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how 900hl.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, 900hl.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>900hl.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on 900hl.com listings. 900hl.com only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that listing commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the listing where the comment was left.</p>


<strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong>
<p>Certain visitors to 900hl.com’s websites choose to interact with 900hl.com in ways that require 900hl.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 900hl.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a listing at 900hl.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with 900hl.com – by purchasing upgrade listing service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, 900hl.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with 900hl.com. 900hl.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

If you are a registered user of an 900hl.com website and have supplied your email address, 900hl.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with 900hl.com and our products. We primarily use our various product listings to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 900hl.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
